For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n\n    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, Object.getPrototypeOf(BeforeAfterWrapper).apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  _createClass(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n      var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n      var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n      var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\n      var afterElement = void 0;\n\n      if (beforeStyle) {\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n          key: '::before'\n        });\n      }\n\n      if (afterStyle) {\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n          key: '::after'\n        });\n      }\n\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n      var props = other;\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n    }\n  }]);\n\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nBeforeAfterWrapper.propTypes = {\n  afterElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  afterStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  beforeElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  beforeStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  children: _react.PropTypes.node,\n  elementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  /**\n   * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n   */\n  style: _react.PropTypes.object\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\n  afterElementType: 'div',\n  elementType: 'div'\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/internal/BeforeAfterWrapper.js\n ** module id = 443\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\nexports.default = undefined;\n\nvar _RaisedButton = require('./RaisedButton');\n\nvar _RaisedButton2 = _interopRequireDefault(_RaisedButton);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

\\n\\nWith BLE, manufacturers can build up their application by using the SIG-defined Characteristics or by their own private GATT definitions. It is quick and flexible, but sometimes sacrifices compatibility between BLE products.  \\n\\n_Imagine a scenario that you are a BLE light bulb user, you've got some in your home, and you are happy to control lights by your smartphone APP._  \\n\\n> Today, a bulb is broken and you're going to buy a new one for change. You find no bulb as same brand as those in your house, and you make your mind to buy a new one manufacturered by another brand.  \\n>  \\n> When you are home, install the new one on the wall, and you find that your current APP is just not working with the new one. Then, you download another specific APP for your new bulb, and now it's working.  \\n> \\n> Soon, you find that switching APPs for controlling those lights is kind of annoying, that is not cool. You feel so frustrated with your BLE lights and, of course, your smartphone BLE APPs.  \\n\\nBIPSO is born to solve this problem of consistency and compatibility for BLE applications. It defines a set of BLE Characteristics that follows the [IPSO Smart Object Guideline](http://www.ipso-alliance.org/smart-object-guidelines/) for developers to build their applications with an unified data model. You don't have to worry about how to map a real-world gadget into BLE Characteristics, IPSO and BIPSO have modeled many for you.  \\n\\nWhat BIPSO is doing is to trying to let you operate all BLE gadgets with only a single smartphone APP, and let BLE gadgets be IPSO-compatible.  \"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./app/docs/spec.md\n ** module id = 617\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","import React from 'react';\nimport Head from '../../Head';\nimport MarkdownElement from '../../MarkdownElement';\nimport CharDefsTable from './CharDefsTable';\nimport charDescReadmeText from '../../../docs/charDesc.md';\nimport charTableReadmeText from '../../../docs/charTable.md';\nimport bipsoUuid from '../../../misc/bipso_uuid.js';\nimport AppBar from 'material-ui/AppBar';\n\nvar bipso = require('bipso'),\n\tsmartObjDesc = require('../../../misc/desc'),\n\tcharTbCss = require('../../../styles/charTable.css');\n\nvar tableContent = {},\n\toInfo;\n\nfor (var key in bipsoUuid) {\n\tif (key !== 'oid') {\n\t\ttableContent[key] = bipsoUuid[key];\n\t}\n}\n\n// for (var key in smartObjDesc) {\n// \toInfo = tableContent[bipso.uo(bipso.ou(key))];\n// \toInfo.desc = oInfo.desc + '.

The **Characteristic Value** is a piece of data containing IPSO Resources on a Smart Object.  \\n  \\nThe following table are cross-references between a IPSO Smart Object and its BIPSO-defined Characteristic, each column in this table is:  \\n\\n* **Object ID**: IPSO Object identifier defined by IPSO Alliance. For example, **lightCtrl** is a light controller Smart Object, its ID is `'lightCtrl'` in string.  \\n* **Char. UUID**: BIPSO-defined Characteristic UUID corresponding to an IPSO Object.  \\n\\n**Notice** \\n* **Possible Fields in Char. Value**: Possible fields within a Characteristic Value. For example, **sensorValue(float)** is a field named `'sensorValue'` and its value is a float number.  \\n    * The boldface field is mandatory while the other fields are optional Resources.  \\n    * A Characteristic Value should be parsed into an data object with these fields as its keys.  \\n    * The mandatory field **flags** is a bit-vector to tell which optional fields does a Characteristic Value have. Let's take 'dIn' Object as an example, if the **flags** has a value of `0000,0001` in binary, then the **Characteristic Value** does only have the `counter` field in it. If the flags is `0000,1110` in binary, then the **Characteristic Value** does have the `dInPolarity`, `debouncePeriod`, and `edgeSelection` fields in it. \\n\"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./app/docs/charDesc.md\n ** module id = 636\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"|  Object ID                    | Char.
