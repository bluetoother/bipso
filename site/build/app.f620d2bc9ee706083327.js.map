For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar styles = {\n  box: {\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\n  }\n};\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\n  _inherits(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\n\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\n\n    return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, Object.getPrototypeOf(BeforeAfterWrapper).apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  _createClass(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\n    key: 'render',\n    value: function render() {\n      var _props = this.props;\n      var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n      var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n      var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n      var // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\n      elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n      var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\n\n\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\n      var afterElement = void 0;\n\n      if (beforeStyle) {\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\n          key: '::before'\n        });\n      }\n\n      if (afterStyle) {\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\n          key: '::after'\n        });\n      }\n\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n      var props = other;\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\n\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n    }\n  }]);\n\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\n}(_react.Component);\n\nBeforeAfterWrapper.propTypes = {\n  afterElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  afterStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  beforeElementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  beforeStyle: _react.PropTypes.object,\n  children: _react.PropTypes.node,\n  elementType: _react.PropTypes.string,\n  /**\n   * Override the inline-styles of the root element.\n   */\n  style: _react.PropTypes.object\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\n  afterElementType: 'div',\n  elementType: 'div'\n};\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\n};\nexports.default = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/internal/BeforeAfterWrapper.js\n ** module id = 379\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\nexports.default = undefined;\n\nvar _RaisedButton = require('./RaisedButton');\n\nvar _RaisedButton2 = _interopRequireDefault(_RaisedButton);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?

It is quick and flexible, but sometimes sacrifices compatibility between BLE products.  \\n\\n_Imagine a scenario that you are a BLE light bulb user, you've got some in your home, and you are happy to control lights by your smartphone APP._  \\n\\n> Today, a bulb is broken and you're going to buy a new one for change. You find no bulb as same brand as those in your house, and you make your mind to buy a new one manufacturered by another brand.  \\n>  \\n> When you are home, install the new one on the wall, and you find that your current APP is just not working with the new one. Then, you download another specific APP for your new bulb, and now it's working.  \\n> \\n> Soon, you find that switching APPs for controlling those lights is kind of annoying, that is not cool. You feel so frustrated with your BLE lights and, of course, your smartphone BLE APPs.  \\n\\nBIPSO is born to solve this problem of consistency and compatibility for BLE applications. It defines a set of BLE Characteristics that follows the [IPSO Smart Object Guideline](http://www.ipso-alliance.org/smart-object-guidelines/) for developers to build their applications with an unified data model. You don't have to worry about how to map a real-world gadget into BLE Characteristics, IPSO and BIPSO have modeled many for you.  \\n\\nWhat BIPSO is doing is to trying to let you operate all BLE gadgets with only a single smartphone APP, and let BLE gadgets be IPSO-compatible.  \"\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./app/docs/spec.md\n ** module id = 384\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","import React from 'react';\nimport Head from '../../Head';\nimport MarkdownElement from '../../MarkdownElement';\nimport CharDefsTable from './CharDefsTable';\nimport charDescReadmeText from '../../../docs/charDesc.md';\nimport bipsoUuid from '../../../misc/bipso_uuid.js';\n\ndelete bipsoUuid.oid;\n\nvar CharPage = React.createClass({\n    render: function () {\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <Head display='navbar'>\n                </Head>\n                <div style={{paddingTop: '64px'}}>\n\t                <div style={{margin: '48px 72px', fontFamily: 'Roboto,sans-serif'}}>\n\t                    <MarkdownElement text={charDescReadmeText} />\n\t                </div>\n\t                <div style={{margin: '48px 72px', padding: '0 90px'}}>\n\t                \t<CharDefsTable table={bipsoUuid} />\n\t                </div>\n\t            </div>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = CharPage;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./app/components/pages/characteristic/Page.js\n **/","import React from 'react';\nimport {Table, TableBody, TableHeader, TableHeaderColumn, TableRow, TableRowColumn} from 'material-ui/Table';\n\n/**************************************************/\n/*** <CharDefsTable table={you_charDefsTable}/> ***/\n/**************************************************/\n\nvar CharColoumn = React.createClass({\n    render: function () {\n        return (\n            <TableRow>\n                <TableRowColumn>{this.props.oid}</TableRowColumn>\n                <TableRowColumn>{this.props.uuid}</TableRowColumn>\n                <TableRowColumn>{this.props.desc}</TableRowColumn>\n            </TableRow>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\nmodule.exports = React.createClass({\n    propTypes: {\n        table: React.PropTypes.object\n    },\n    render: function () {\n        var charArray = [];\n\n        for(var index in this.props.table) {\n            charArray.push(\n                <CharColoumn oid={index} \n                             uuid= {this.props.table[index].uuid}\n                             desc= {this.props.table[index].desc} />\n            );\n        }\n\n        return (\n            <div>\n                <Table selectable={false}>\n                    <TableHeader displaySelectAll={false}>\n                        <TableRow>\n                            <TableHeaderColumn>OID</TableHeaderColumn>\n                            <TableHeaderColumn>UUID</TableHeaderColumn>\n                            <TableHeaderColumn>Description</TableHeaderColumn>\n                        </TableRow>\n                    </TableHeader>\n                <TableBody displayRowCheckbox={false}>\n                    {charArray}\n                </TableBody>\n              </Table>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./app/components/pages/characteristic/CharDefsTable.js\n **/","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\nexports.default = exports.TableRowColumn = exports.TableRow = exports.TableHeaderColumn = exports.TableHeader = exports.TableFooter = exports.TableBody = exports.Table = undefined;\n\nvar _Table2 = require('./Table');\n\nvar _Table3 = _interopRequireDefault(_Table2);\n\nvar _TableBody2 = require('./TableBody');\n\nvar _TableBody3 = _interopRequireDefault(_TableBody2);\n\nvar _TableFooter2 = require('./TableFooter');\n\nvar _TableFooter3 = _interopRequireDefault(_TableFooter2);\n\nvar _TableHeader2 = require('./TableHeader');\n\nvar _TableHeader3 = _interopRequireDefault(_TableHeader2);\n\nvar _TableHeaderColumn2 = require('./TableHeaderColumn');\n\nvar _TableHeaderColumn3 = _interopRequireDefault(_TableHeaderColumn2);\n\nvar _TableRow2 = require('./TableRow');\n\nvar _TableRow3 = _interopRequireDefault(_TableRow2);\n\nvar _TableRowColumn2 = require('./TableRowColumn');\n\nvar _TableRowColumn3 = _interopRequireDefault(_TableRowColumn2);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?
